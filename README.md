# A Practical Casebook For Business Associations

This is a free, open-access casebook for an entry-level Business Associations/Business Organizations/Corporations law school course.  It can be readily modified to fit the instructor's needs.

## Description

"A Practical Casebook For Business Associations" is available as a PDF, which you can then distribute via email or on your course website.  It is written in LaTeX through the Overleaf website, which allows me to quickly and easily create a version for your specific course.  

## Getting Started

While you might be fine using a version that features Kentucky law and reflects my personal tastes, this casebook is meant to be modified, edited, and keyed to your particular classroom preferences.

### Take A Look, It's In A Book

The first step is to peruse the casebook to see if it's right for you.

* The PDF of the most recent version I am using is uploaded to my Github repository here: [github](https://github.com/alanjameskluegel/business_associations_casebook/blob/main/Business_Associations_Casebook.pdf)
* The raw .tex files are available to read here: [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qvfhqfbkqrmk).  

### Reach Out And Touch Someone

If you are interested, email me at alan.kluegel@uky.edu and I will create a version of this casebook for you. You may choose to edit the file on Overleaf as a collaborator, or I can simply send you a PDF of your version when it is ready.

### Have It Your Way

Once you have your very own copy, you can choose to change, add, or remove various features. This includes:

* Changing the references to specific state laws to whichever state you choose. (As of right now I only have KY, DC, and IL, but I am more than happy to work with you to add your state corporate law to the master file.)
* Adding or removing particular cases.
* Including in the text any practice problems you might want students to work on.
* Introducing particular chapters with a glossary of terms. (I am currently working on this feature.)
* Deleting parts of the text you don't need, up to and including my annoying sidenotes.

## License

Did I mention this is a free, open-access casebook?  Yeah.  See LICENSE.txt for more information.
